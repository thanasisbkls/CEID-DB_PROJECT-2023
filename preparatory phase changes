1. 	Changed primary key on worker table because a worker is uniquely
	described by his id and the branch that he works for.

2.	Kept only first 10 brances instead of 30. Better for testing. Allowed by 	 the project's requirments.

3.	3 phone numbers per branch now instead of 1. Made new inserts.

4.	Kept 60 records for the workers table. Changed the branch codes
	accordingly

	1-10 -> guides
	11-20 -> drivers
	21-30 -> admin (ADMINISTRATIVE)!!! Ένα υποκατάστημα διοικείται 		
										υποχρεωτικά από έναν διοικητικό 
										υπάλληλο που ανήκει στην κατηγορία ‘ADMINISTRATIVE’. 
	31-40 -> admin(ACCOUNTING)
	41-50 -> admin(LOGISTICS)


	Now each branch has 1 admin per type!!! 

	We have 10 extra workers to spare!!!


5. 	Fixed manages table's inserts
